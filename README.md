# csr_matrix_vectors_linear_system_of_eqs_solver

csr is an efficient way of defining large but sparse matrices. 
this repo is capable of converting fully populates into sparse matrices and solves the linear system of equations.
readme could be better, code could be better, refactoring is necessary.
